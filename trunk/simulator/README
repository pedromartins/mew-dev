TEMPORARY WORKAROUND
***

pedro can fix this properly later, but for the moment you can write and compile
a working simulator a'la the example now in simulator/src/sample.c

compile with:
gcc -o foo *.c

****************************************
  mew Imperial College Robot Simulator
****************************************

This is just a simple simulator of a platform similar to the one we'll
be experiencing with actual hardware.

For the users of the simulator it is composed of the following files,
in subdirectory release:

include/sim.h : The header file which contains the public functions that
	      	are available.
lib/libsim.a  : The library object file itself, designed for static
	      	linking.

In the samples folder, you can also find some very naive samples. 

To compile and link them use gcc as such:
gcc -o <exec-file> <c-file> -lsim -L<library-file-location>

This should give you an executable.

Have fun!

For people who want to improve the simulator, the source code is in
src. The code is not perfect by any means so feel free to improve it,
it was quickly assembled for this meeting :) Thanks!
