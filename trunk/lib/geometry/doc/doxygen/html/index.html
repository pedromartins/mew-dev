Geometry Library</a></h2>
This Geometry Library is considered to be proposed to Boost, and is prepared for Boost until a certain point. It is not part of Boost.<p>

Introduction</a></h2>
The Geometry Library provides a generic implementation of <a class="el" href="namespacegeometry.html">geometry</a> algorithms, with the ability to work with any user-defined type of points in any number of dimensions. It also proposes some point classes for those who don't have any already defined point type, and provides classes like polygon or box for more complex operations.<p>
The algorithms include some well-known and often needed algorithms as point-in-polygon, polygon area, point-to-point distance, point-to-line distance, line clipping and polygon clipping. The algorithms work, of course, on the <a class="el" href="namespacegeometry.html">geometry</a> classes provided by the library, but they also work on <a class="el" href="namespacegeometry.html">geometry</a> classes defined by the library user.<p>
The library follows conventions used in the std:: library and in the boost:: libraries. It also follows, where possible, the OGC names and conventions. OGC is the Open Geospatial Consortium, the standardization committee on GIS (Geographical Information Systems). OGC geometries are used in many environments, among others in databases (Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL). OGC specifies a library based on inheritance, as opposed to this library, which is a template library where data classes are strictly separated from the algorithms. Therefore it is not an OGC implementation (but an OGC implementation could be built with this library).<h2><a class="anchor" name="platforms">
Platforms</a></h2>
The library currently compiles successfully on the following platforms:<ul>
<li>MS Visual Studio 2008 (Express Edition)</li><li>MS Visual Studio 2005 (Express Edition)</li><li>gcc version 3.4</li><li>gcc version 4.1</li><li>gcc version 4.2</li></ul>
<p>
It doesn't compile on the following platform:<ul>
<li>MS Visual Studio 2003 (some compiler issues)</li><li>MS Visual Studio 6 (because of nested templates)</li></ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="history">
History</a></h2>
Geodan started in 1995 with a Geographic Library, called geolib. Since then hundreds of projects have been done using this geolib, and the geolib have been extended to fit the needs of its users. Geolib can be used in different environments: in Windows applications, as a DLL (ggl32.dll), in Web Map Servers (SclMapServer), Web Feature Servers or more specific programs.<p>
In 2007/2008 the Geometry part has been revised and completely templatized. In 2008 Bruno Lalande, already a Boost contributor, joined and helped to make the library even more generic and to define clear concepts. The Geometry Library is Open Source and will be proposed to the Boost community.<p>
This is preview 3.<p>
