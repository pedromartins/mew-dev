<h1><a class="anchor" name="changes3">Changes since preview 2 </a></h1>This page shortly lists the changes which are made from preview 2 to preview 3. There are many changes, the whole library has been reworked again. Only the most important changes are described below.<h2><a class="anchor" name="ChangesConcepts">
ChangesConcepts</a></h2>
In preview 2 the concepts were not yet completely clear. In preview 3 the concepts have been worked out and are now designed using MPL and BCCL (Boost Concept Check Library). For more information check the <a class="el" href="concepts.html#Concepts">Concepts</a> or go to the <a class="el" href="structgeometry_1_1_point.html">Point</a> concept.<h2><a class="anchor" name="Structure">
Structure</a></h2>
The folder structure has been organized, there are subfolders for geometries, algorithmes, etc.<h2><a class="anchor" name="multi">
Multi geometries</a></h2>
Multi geometries, defined by OGC, have been deleted. They were used in algorithms as intersection, because intersecting a linestring by a box might deliver more than one line, so a multi-linestring. However, the algorithms now are designed more generic and take output iteratators and therefore the multi geometries are not absolutely necessary anymore.<p>
They might come back because they are defined by OGC, if all basic concepts are completely worked out.<h2><a class="anchor" name="linestring">
Linestring</a></h2>
Linestrings are not a primary <a class="el" href="namespacegeometry.html">geometry</a> anymore. All algorithms also work on iterator pairs. Algorithms therefore now also work on plain vectors or other standard containers, or on C arrays.<h2><a class="anchor" name="test">
Tests</a></h2>
Many tests have been added, using the Boost test suites. </div>
