<h1><a class="anchor" name="changes2">Changes since preview 1 </a></h1><h2><a class="anchor" name="Structure">
Structure</a></h2>
In preview 1 there were two layers: algorithms and implementations.<p>
In this preview 2 there are three layers:<ul>
<li>algorithms, working on the Geometry Library <a class="el" href="namespacegeometry.html">geometry</a> data structures</li><li>implementation, implementations of algorithms, working on a more abstract base on any <a class="el" href="namespacegeometry.html">geometry</a> which satisfies the concept</li><li>strategies: classes operating on a specific point type</li></ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="Documentation">
Documentation</a></h2>
The documentation has been changed. Doxygen is now used to generate all documentation. There are many short examples.<h2><a class="anchor" name="Points">
Points</a></h2>
The point type is changed completely. In preview 1 all points were required to have members as x() and y(). There were many comments on this design, already before the preview was posted.<p>
The new <a class="el" href="classgeometry_1_1point.html" title="Basic point class, having coordinates dfined in a neutral way.">geometry::point</a>:<ul>
<li>has now a dimension which is templatized (this makes also 3D points possible)</li><li>they are coordinate neutral, implemented internally as an array</li></ul>
<p>
There are currently the following derived points:<ul>
<li><a class="el" href="classgeometry_1_1point__xy.html" title="2D point in Cartesian coordinate system">geometry::point_xy</a> with members x() and y()</li><li><a class="el" href="classgeometry_1_1point__ll.html" title="Point using spherical coordinates lat and lon, on Earth.">geometry::point_ll</a> with members lat() and lon()</li><li>more derived points are possible, for example point_xyz or point_rgb</li></ul>
<p>
Derived points should have corresponding strategies (primitive algorithms). See for more information the page <a class="el" href="points.html">Point concepts, point types, strategies, and algorithms</a>.<p>
This change is based on suggestions made on the boost mailinglist by Hervé Brönnimann.<h2><a class="anchor" name="oi">
Output iterators</a></h2>
In preview 1 the intersection of a linestring with a box resulted in a multi-linestring. This has been changed. The intersection algorithms now produces intersected linestrings which are sent to output iterators. This suggestion was made on the boost mailinglist by Phil Endecott.<h2><a class="anchor" name="mg">
Multi geometries</a></h2>
In preview 1 the intersection algorithms resulted in a multi-linstring. This was one of the reasons to have the multi_polygon / multi_linestring. Other reasons are the OGC model, and that it is a standard GIS concept.<h2><a class="anchor" name="ip">
Iterator pairs</a></h2>
In preview 1 all linestring-algorithms worked on the whole linestring. Now, in addition, they also work on an interator pair. This suggestion was made on the boost mailinglist by Phil Endecott.<h2><a class="anchor" name="dr">
Distance results</a></h2>
In preview 1 the primary distance algorithms were named "squared_" and resulted in square distances, for performance reasons. This is valid for xy-points but not for some other points, such as latlong points. Therefore the distance algorithms now return "distance_result" structures, containing the distance and a boolean indicating if it is squared.<h2><a class="anchor" name="ns">
Namespaces</a></h2>
In preview 1 all code was located within namespace <a class="el" href="namespacegeometry.html">geometry</a>. This has been changed. The design, which in preview 1 had already two layers, has now three layers (based on changes in points). The layers are reflected in namespaces:<ul>
<li>namespace <a class="el" href="namespacegeometry.html">geometry</a> for OGC and non OGC algorithms, working on <a class="el" href="namespacegeometry.html">geometry</a>:: geometry-types</li><li>namespace impl for algorithms, working on template <a class="el" href="namespacegeometry.html">geometry</a> types G (where G are types implemented with the required concepts). They are called by the algorithms from namespace <a class="el" href="namespacegeometry.html">geometry</a>.</li><li>namespace strategy for more primitive algorithms working specificly on points, for example on point_xy or on point_ll. They are called by the impl-algorithms.</li></ul>
<p>
This change in namespace has an additional positive effect. There were some comments on naming of some of the primary algorithms, for example within_point_in_polygon. This is now changed in point_in_polygon, residing in namespace impl::within<h2><a class="anchor" name="WKT">
WKT (Well-Known Text)</a></h2>
The well-known-text implementation has been changed completely. In preview 1 all geometries could be streamed as well-known-text. This made streaming of other formats inconvenient. Now the library user can choose how and what he wants to be streamed.<p>
Besides that, there is a new algorithm from_wkt which parses WKT. </div>
