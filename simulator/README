  mew Imperial College Robot Simulator
****************************************

This is just a simple simulator of a platform similar to the one we'll
be experiencing with actual hardware.

For the users of the simulator it is composed of the following files,
in subdirectory release:

include/sim.h : The header file which contains the public functions that
	      	are available.
lib/libsim.a  : The library object file itself, designed for static
	      	linking.

In the samples folder, you can also find some very naive samples. To
compile them you can use the makefile that is in the release/
folder. So, if you cd to to the release folder and type "make", you
should get the samples built in the release/bin folder.

To compile and link your own examples for testing you can use gcc as:
gcc <c-file> -I<include-dir> -lsim -L<library-file-location> -o <out-file>

This should give you an executable.


Have fun!

For people who want to improve the simulator, the source code is in
src. The code is not perfect by any means so feel free to improve it,
it was quickly assembled for this meeting :) Thanks!

Also in the source code folder is a sample made by ian that can be
compiled along with the simulator.
