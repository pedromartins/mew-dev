# Sensors #

If people, both Software and Electronics could post here both the sensors they want and how they will work!

## Sharp IR ##
Extremely popular robotics IR range finders produced by Sharp. They are small, low power and offer high immunity to ambient light. Range is communicated through an analogue voltage (non-linear) Click [here](http://www.acroname.com/robotics/info/articles/sharp/sharp.html) for more information.

## Ultrasonic Range Finders ##
Another popular sensor produced by Devantech. Depending on which sensor, it can communicate with a MCU using I2C, serial (USART) or a sort of pulse width modulation. More information can be found [here](http://www.acroname.com/robotics/info/articles/devantech/srf.html).
