Camel-Case is a coding convention.

When writing code, if you want to name a struct, class or a typedef'ed type with multiple words in its name (CustomerBankAccount, for example) then:

  * Capitalize the first letter of every word.
  * Leave no spaces in between the words.


## Examples ##
`struct SomeLovelyFunctionalStruct {}; `

`class SomethingHasGoneTerriblyWrongException {};`

`typedef SomeTemplate<int> IThinkYouGetThePointByNow;`
