/**
 * BasicRobot
 *
 * A basic robot is a robot that simply navigates a
 * grid-based model.
 *
 * Such a robot must be able to support the most basic
 * functions such as:
 *
 * - getting its own position in terms of the grid-based
 *   model
 * - moving forward a number of squares
 * - turning left and right.
 * - stopping
 * - picking something up with its claw
 *
 * The location of a robot is only meaningful in the context
 * of its current Model.
 * If the robot has no model, i.e. model == NULL
 * then the robot must rely on odometry at all times.
 *
