Use this page to add any ideas you get for robotic vision

# Cameras #
There are 2 main hobbyist robotics cameras with embedded microcontrollers:
  * [CMUcam](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cmucam/)
  * [AVRcam](http://www.jrobot.net/Projects/AVRcam.html)


# Software #
[Roborealm](http://www.roborealm.com/) is a great piece of software to play with computer vision using a webcam.


## Software Libraries ##
[OpenCV](http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/) is a software library for computer vision. It is implemented in C, and has an in-built Python interface, amongst many others.
There is a electronic copy of the book ["Learning OpenCV"](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Learning-OpenCV-Computer-Vision-Library/dp/0596516134/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1232278953&sr=8-1) in the [files section](http://groups.google.com/group/mew-imperial-college/files) of our google group.
