#summary Info about Robot Operating System (ROS)

= Introduction =
[http://www.ros.org/wiki/ ROS] is a robotics development environment and framework that provides many bindings to useful tools, packaging facilities, and a lot of other goodies. 
Contrary to what its name may suggest, ROS is not really an operating system, but its various shell-scripts integrate well into the UNIX or UNIX-like environments well via the shell commands and daemons such that it appears to become a part of your opearting system.

= Installation =
To install ROS, follow the instructions on [http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Installation].

== Troubleshooting ==
If you get compilation errors about some uint_8 type not being declared, then add the following line in the #include section of the source code file in question and recompile:
{{{
#include <stdint.h>
}}}

== Fixing rxgraph ==
If you're experiencing problems when running rxgraph on [tutorial 6] and running into strange exceptions:
{{{
Type error: font_options must be of type cairo.FontOptions or None
}}}
then download the lastest xdot script (used to render nice diagrammatic things) [http://jrfonseca.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/xdot/xdot.py here] and replace the ROS one.
This will cause a few incompatibilities with ros/tools/rosgraph/src/rosgraph/rxgraph.py, so let's fix those:

Remove the second parameter of the __init__ call (the numbers may vary)
{{{
rosgraph.xdot.DotWindow.__init__(self, (1024, 768))
}}}
so that it looks like
{{{
rosgraph.xdot.DotWindow.__init__(self)
}}}
and then comment out the line
{{{
self.widget.set_on_rotate(self.on_rotate)
}}}
so that it looks like
{{{
# self.widget.set_on_rotate(self.on_rotate)
}}}

= Development with ROS =
The great thing about ROS is that all the code we have written can be carefully 
== Porting existing C/C++ code ==
The code that we have written is C/C++ based, and for our sensors, they fit snuggly  into the ROS model of modular design as a 'publisher'.
