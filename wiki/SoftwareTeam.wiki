Welcome to the Software Team subwiki.
I have broken down some of the main areas to be tackled.
If it looks like a lot of work, don't worry!! It's nowhere as complicated as it sounds =]
I've moved everything around once again- re-decided which functionality goes where, etc.
With a bit of explanation, everybody should understand what's going on.
