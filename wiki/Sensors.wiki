#summary A list of the sensors envisaged, their interfaces and so on

If people, both Software and Electronics could post here both the sensors they want and how they will work!

== Sharp IR ==
Extremely popular robotics IR range finders produced by Sharp. They are small, low power and offer high immunity to ambient light. Range is output with an analogue voltage (non-linear) Click [http://www.acroname.com/robotics/info/articles/sharp/sharp.html here] for more information.

==  Ultrasonic Range Finders ==
Another popular sensor produced by Devantech. Depending on which sensor, it can communicate with a MCU using I2C, serial (USART) or a sort of pulse width modulation. More information can be found [http://www.acroname.com/robotics/info/articles/devantech/srf.html here].
