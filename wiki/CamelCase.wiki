#summary A simple explanation of what Camel-Case
#labels Phase-Requirements

Camel-Case is a coding convention.

When writing code, if you want to name a class with multiple words in its name (CustomerBankAccount, for example) or typedef'ed type, then:

  * Capitalize the first letter of every word.
  * Leave no spaces in between the words.

{{{class SomethingHasGoneTerriblyWrongException }}}
{{{typedef SomeTemplate<int> IThinkYouGetThePointByNow}}}
