= Cameras =
There are 2 main hobbyist robotics cameras with embedded microcontrollers:
  * [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cmucam/ CMUcam]
  * [http://www.jrobot.net/Projects/AVRcam.html AVRcam]


= Software =
[http://www.roborealm.com/ Roborealm] is a great piece of software to play with computer vision using a webcam.


== Software Libraries ==
[http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/ OpenCV] is a software library for computer vision. It is implemented in C, and has an in-built Python interface, amongst many others.
There is a electronic copy of the book [http://www.amazon.co.uk/Learning-OpenCV-Computer-Vision-Library/dp/0596516134/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1232278953&sr=8-1 "Learning OpenCV"] in the [http://groups.google.com/group/mew-imperial-college/files files section] of our google group.
