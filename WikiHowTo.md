The Google Code wiki is just a very simple markup.

In fact, when you click 'Edit This Page' (see that in the blue bar at above this, by the search box?) you are taken to the editing screen where there is a simple cheatsheet.


## Things it took me a few minutes to realise: ##


### It is picky about whitespace ###

  * 'Shows how to make an indented list, when preceeded by its quotation',

> ` * shows how to make an indented list, when preceeded by its quotation. `

**Notice the space both before _and_ after the `*`.**



### To make a normal text link use this: ###

` [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willard_Van_Orman_Quine Quine] `

> [Quine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willard_Van_Orman_Quine)

which is of the format

> ` [<URL> <text>] `



<sup>also, i just copyrighted that amazing quine. if you know what a quine is without clicking that link, then just ask yourself why...</sup>
